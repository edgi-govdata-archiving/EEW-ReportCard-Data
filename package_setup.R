# Hi! If you're opening this file hopefully it is because you're interested in this project and
# want to personally explore or start contributing. Below is a function that will install all
# of the packages you need to get started. Of course, if you are already working with R, you might
# have many of these packages already.

# We will do our best to keep this updated, but it may miss a few here and there as this evolves.
